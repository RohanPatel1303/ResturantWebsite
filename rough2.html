                            the intention of giving their children the best future. His mother's wizardy in the
                            kitchen whipping up the tastiest dishes with whatever is available inexpensively at
                            the supermarket, was his first inspiration to create the fusion cuisines for which
                            <em>The Frying Pan</em> became well known. He brings his zeal for fusion cuisines to
